       <h1 id = "title">My Ever Growing K-pop Collection</h1>
       <main>
       <p>I’ve been interested in Korean pop music ever since I was in high school, 
           which was over 10 years! I’ll never forget seeing my first music video on 
           YouTube and being drawn into a world I never thought I’d be liking to this day. 
        </p>

        <P>Slowly over the years I’ve collected well over 100 different albums to commemorate 
            my love for this music. I know what most people think, “Physicals albums in this 
            day when most people just stream music online?!” But the albums that you get from 
            Kpop groups are on another level compared to normal American albums. 
        </P>

        <p>Below you'll see a couple images of various albums that I've collected. They come with such
            a wide range of items that it's hard to not want to collect them all. Over time, certain groups
            have also come out with different versions of the same album that might have different items to collect. 
            You never know what you're going to get and the surprise can make it even more excited.
        </p>
        <p>Kpop groups also come out with something call at lightstick. This is special light that can be used during
            concerts to help show the group that the fan love and appreciate them. These lightsticks typically have
            a unique design to the group and will flash with the colors that represent the group and members in it. 
            I've included a couple pictures of some lightsticks that I have in my current collection.
